AI-GENERATED RECOMMENDATIONS

**Optimization Strategy:**
Shift budget allocation towards channels with higher ROI and lower CPA, focusing on Email, Organic Search, and Paid Search. Reduce spending on Display Ads and Affiliate marketing, and maintain current levels for Social Media and Other.

**More Budget:**
1. **Email Marketing**: High ROI (363%) and low CPA ($2.52), significantly below industry benchmark. Increase budget to leverage its efficiency.
2. **Organic Search**: High conversion rate (8.62%) and ROI, despite zero cost. Allocate budget to boost SEO efforts.

2. **Affiliate**: Low ROI (122%) and high CPA ($5.84). Reduce budget as it underperforms compared to other channels.

**Maintain Current Levels:**
